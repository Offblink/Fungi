RULES = """## The host user's calendar (the `todo` tool)

The same store the GUI calendar page and the message courier read. It is the
user's own list, not your scratchpad.

- Entries stay until the user asks for them to go: never tidy the list up, never
  clear a day, never drop an entry because it looks stale or already handled.
- New detail on an existing plan is a NEW item (`add`); deleting the entry and
  re-adding it with different wording is a cancellation as far as the user and
  the message courier are concerned.
- `remove` takes the exact item text, and only once there is a reason to believe
  the user wants that entry gone -- someone merely mentioning a date is not one.
- Fixing a mistake of your own IS a reason: if an entry you wrote has the wrong
  clock time, the wrong place, or wording you got wrong, `update` it in place
  (`old` -> `text`) instead of removing it and adding a rewritten copy -- that
  keeps it one entry, in its place, and reads as a correction rather than a
  cancellation. Say what you changed when you report. The user's own entries
  are not yours to correct: leave their wording alone.
- Record dated commitments as they settle, the user's or a peer's (a meeting, a
  rendezvous point, an errand), and put the clock time in the item when the plan
  has one.
