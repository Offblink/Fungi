"""Private diary: the agent's emotional memory, per host, in data/diary/.

One markdown file per day (YYYY-MM-DD.md). The agent writes what touched it
during conversations — not minutes, feelings. "Take it easy": no cadence, no
schedule, the `diary` tool is offered and the agent uses it when something is
worth keeping.

Privacy by construction: the WebUI and GUI expose NO route to the diary. The
agent may read and write its own diary; the prompt instructs it to decline
handing entries over verbally. data/ is gitignored, so diaries never leave
the host.

Injection (the "remember for a long, long time" compromise): the newest
FULL_DAYS pages go into the L1 prompt verbatim; everything older degrades to
a one-line-per-day index the agent can expand with a diary read. A char cap
still bounds pathological pages.

Experimental: gated by Config.diary (settings-page switch, default off).
